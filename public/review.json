I miss the good ole days when the belt was right up front and took all of five minutes to replace….but I digress.",

I found fasteners in the box that worked but I had to remove some to make adjustments to something and that is when I discovered how cheap the plastic was. The heads just crumbled under any amount of pressure to remove.",
